# LLManager
An universe of LLMs

- each .md file contains the condensed knowledge about that topic, which is written by me based on my reading note of that paper and my own understanding, sometimes contains cross-reference
- sometimes jupyter notebook (or code snippets) will be included
- sometime topics also contain an optional link to the paper reading note
